The Ecosystem Science Division (ESD) at the [Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center) does some pretty cool stuff using gliders, in both the California Current Ecosystem and the Antarctic Peninsula regions. This website is an in-development manual for all ESD glider activities. Please contact a member of the glider team with any questions.

Funding for the glider lab comes from base funding of the ESD Programs: Scientific Operations and Support (SOS), United States Antarctic Marine Living Resources (U.S. AMLR), and Offshore Wind. Additional funding also comes from the NOAA Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) strategic initiatives; UXS-OC (REFOCUS etc.).

For information about past deployments by the ESD glider lab, see [this page](content/past-deployments.qmd)

## Project Management

For most current Fleet Status information, see [this Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tB3QNKYx8qOYYS9QZotekBAx0y-_n2d-EZPjFFdYNuU/edit?usp=sharing)

The ESD glider team is using GitHub Issues and Projects for project management. There efforts are heavily inspired and influenced by the Openscapes [GitHub for project management](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/github-issues.html) approach.

The [ESD glider team project](https://github.com/orgs/us-amlr/projects/1) pulls from issues from several repositories, but in particular [this repo](https://github.com/us-amlr/glider-lab). For more details see the [best practices](content/best-practices.qmd) page.

### GitHub Repositories

GitHub repos developed by the ESD glider team. Issues for these repos are tracked in the above-linked Project.
