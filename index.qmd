The Ecosystem Science Division conducts research using gliders. 

Current outline/working doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1nxoBkeEcXmXGOOioQHqD6A_KIdJmDsg9P_Nfe5Y-o/edit?usp=sharing).

Ideas for things to mention here on the home page:

* Link to Glider Lab GitHub project and issue-tracking repo. 
* Some type of table display of all deployments. Ideally this has links or some way of pointing to the data once it's on ERDDAP
* Points to Fleet Status page
* List team members and roles, to inform who to contact
