The Ecosystem Science Division (ESD) at the [Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center){target="_blank"} does some pretty cool science using gliders, in both the California Current Ecosystem and the Antarctic Peninsula regions. This website is an in-development manual for all ESD glider activities. Please contact a member of the glider team with any questions.

The ESD's glider fleet is managed by the Scientific Operations and Support (SOS) Program, and supports several research objectives within the ESD. We provide expertise across multiple autonomous platforms to deliver robust data for ecosystem monitoring and fisheries management.

For information about past deployments by the ESD glider lab, see [Past Deployments](content/past-deployments.qmd)

## Project Management

For most current Fleet Status information, see [this Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tB3QNKYx8qOYYS9QZotekBAx0y-_n2d-EZPjFFdYNuU/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

The ESD glider team is using GitHub Issues and Projects for project management. There efforts are heavily inspired and influenced by the Openscapes [GitHub for project management](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/github-issues.html){target="_blank"} approach.

The [ESD glider team project](https://github.com/orgs/SWFSC/projects/5/views/1){target="_blank"} pulls from issues from several repositories, but in particular [this repo](https://github.com/SWFSC/glider-lab){target="_blank"}. For more details see the [best practices](content/best-practices.qmd) page.

### GitHub Repositories
