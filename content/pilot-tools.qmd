[Slocum Fleet Mission Control](https://sfmc.webbresearch.com/sfmc/login) SFMC from Teledyne. Where to pilot the gliders using Iridium.

[Argos](https://argos-system.clsamerica.com/argos-cwi2/login.html) Check where the gliders are if they miss a call in.

[Datahost](https://datahost.webbresearch.com/) A good resource. It has the firmware builds for the gliders, Masterdata for the different firmware, TWR glider sheets, such as, Ballast, Functional Checkout, etc. Most forms are in Resources.

[Masterdata](https://gliderfs2.coas.oregonstate.edu/gliderweb/masterdata/)

[Teledyne Customer Portal](https://tmv-taptone.my.site.com/slocum/s/) Where to check the status of service on gliders and glider parts.

[OceanGNS](https://www.oceangns.com/login) A program that can track multiple gliders as well as has different layers. The layers can be depth average currents, sea ice, chlorophyll, etc.

[Sensor Settings and Sampling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNjvXY9RhGC8St3bXdfQx6tWN10sF8evctD0B_RcTKk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) Where mission planners input the settings for sensors and how they should sample.

[Ballast sheet from Rutgers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BrgEZyT4qzZ22Rkcxc7ZHFRZ-m1zfW3o/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true&gid=2132005041#gid=2132005041)
