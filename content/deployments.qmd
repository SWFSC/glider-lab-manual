## Glider Deployments

The below table lists all (in progress) ESD (and formerly AERD) glider deployments, along with basic information about the deployment. The table also includes links to post-deployment reports, and links to data files where they exist. See [below](#data-links) for details on the data links.

Note that deployment names are always 'glider name'-'year-month-day'. For instance, deployment "amlr08-20220530" is the deployment of glider amlr08 that began on 30 May 2022.

See the [Fleet Status sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSIi44OTEUQXPJwwiy1emhdIyRs9Vt8iT5IlJBMrPLA/edit?usp=sharing) (NOAA internal) for more details.

### Data Links

NOTE: cdom data in the various deployment files should be treated as unreliable until further notice. See [this issue](https://github.com/SWFSC/glider-lab/issues/70) for more details, and the latest updates.

The above table contains several links to different data products.

The 'Reports' column contains links to various ESD-internal reports, detailing aspects of the glider prep, deployment, and/or recovery. These reports are in the process of being converted to Quarto documents, after which they will be published externally.

The 'ERDDAP' column will contain the link to the glider dataset when it is published to the [ERDDAP](https://gliders.ioos.us/erddap/index.html) of the [IOOS National Glider Data Assembly Center](https://gliders.ioos.us/).

The 'Internal Data' and 'Internal Directories' columns contains links to various data products and directories that are in the ESD Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Links only appear in the table if the data procuct exists. These data can only be accessed by users with appropriate permissions in the ESD GCP project. Current internal product/directory links:

- **timeseries-sci**, **gridded-5m**, **imagery-csv**: Selected products from the ['base' glider processing](slocum-glider-data.qmd#base-processing) workflow.
- **plots**: The plots for the corresponding deployment. See a description of the standard post-deployment plots [here](data-management.html#deployments). 
- **glider**: All glider-related data products from the ['base' glider processing](slocum-glider-data.qmd#base-processing) workflow. 
- **acoustics**: The 'acoustics' deployment folder. See a description of the structure and contents of this folder [here](data-management.qmd#acoustics). 
- **imagery**: The 'raw imagery' deployment folder. See a description of the structure and contents of this folder [here](data-management.qmd#raw-imagery)

See [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWxq79JPuD5A92XTeH-FVJYA87qW2UlfEtKU1yxrSb8/edit?usp=sharing) for information about downloading full directories from a Google Cloud bucket.

## Projects

The ESD deploys gliders under several different projects:

* **FREEBYRD**: Operation FREEBYRD is a long-term program to replace ship-based surveys with autonomous vehicles to estimate Antarctic krill biomass in support of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

* **REFOCUS**: Reimagining Ecosystem and Fisheries Observations by Combining two UxS fleets (REFOCUS) aims to augment ship-based ecosystem monitoring using autonomous underwater gliders equipped with sensors for monitoring the physical and biological environment. The three primary objectives are to 1) Conduct regular (approximately every other month) deployments in the California Current in areas where the CalCOFI Program currently samples and is likely to sample in the future; 2) Improve capacity to collect data during event-driven ecosystem perturbations (e.g., marine heatwaves or harmful algal blooms); and 3) To alleviate competition for ship time.

* **ECOSWIM**: Operation ECOSWIM is for glider surveys in the California CCE off of Humboldt and Morro Bay, California, in the Southern California waters of the Pacific Ocean. These surveys may collect krill biomass estimates, among other scientific goals.

* **SANDIEGO**: Test deployments off of the greater San Diego area, typically either around Mission Bay, off the Scripps Pier, or off of Oceanside. These deployments may be, for instance, to test a glider before it goes to the Antarctic, or to test new sensors and/or sensor configurations for a NMFS Strategic Initiative (e.g., the Enhanced Data Acquisition Passive Acoustics, Optics, or Uncrewed Systems Strategic Initiatives).
