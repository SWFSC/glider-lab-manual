title: Data Management
---

Glider data management is a complex endeavor. Gliders contain many moving parts, and can collect over a terabyte of data in a single deployment. This page outlines the ESD glider data management efforts, including directory strucutres and storage locations for different types of data.

(In progress: a Shiny app or some other tool for users to use to get to GCS bucket URL for a particular piece of data)

## Data Management Plan

This section replaces the [AMLR Glider Data Management Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dW5ZdkOpTz59xy4xs8ypVOvGLWBYZMdlbwGJty4PTV0/edit?usp=sharing) Google doc. 

### Glider & Mooring Database

The glider and mooring database is a SQL Server database, hosted on the internal SWFSC network. This database exists to track all of the glider/instrument (and mooring) parts and builds. Each glider deployment is represented as a build, and each build includes links to all of the different parts that were on that glider for the deployment. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKMjSfp_QYXo66buBBd0NiJ7NqUk52FV95NxSW766Vc/edit?usp=sharing) for more detailed information.

### GCS Buckets
