Autoballast states

0 = uninitialized

1 = initialized, still converging

2 = converged successfully

3 = converged unsuccessfully: abs (c_dive_bpump_ or c_climb_bpump > X_BALLAST_PUMPED_MAX/X_DE_OIL_VOL_MAX

4 = converged unsuccessfully: c_climb_bpump - c_dived_bpump < c_autoballast_volume (D_bpump_value)

5 = converged unsuccessfully: may be a bit more complicated. Consider examining .mlg
